# Messaging

## Differences from the book

It's a simple app from the fifth chapter of the Fullstack React Native book with a slight twist
1. Using **functional components**
2. Using **React Hooks** as opposed to class based lifecycle methods

## Getting started

```
cd messaging

npm install

npm start

```
